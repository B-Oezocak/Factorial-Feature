## What is Factorial Feature?

[Factorial Feature](https://github.com/B-Oezocak/Factorial-Feature) is a project to create a comprehensive test suite for my JavaScript codebase using Mocha test framework and assert methods from the Node.js standard library to drive development using tests that follow the setup, exercise, and verification phases. Testing is a crucial aspect of software development that ensures our code functions as intended and helps prevent bugs from reaching production. By implementing a robust set of tests, we aim to improve the reliability and maintainability of our code.

## Purpose of the Project

The main goal of this project is to demonstrate and enhance my skills in writing effective tests for JavaScript applications. By the end of this project, the test suite will:

- Verify Correct Functionality: Ensure that all functions and modules in my codebase perform their intended tasks correctly.
- Detect Bugs Early: Identify and catch bugs or errors in the code before they can affect users.
- Facilitate Refactoring: Provide a safety net that allows developers to refactor and optimize the code with confidence, knowing that existing functionality will remain intact.
- Document Code Behavior: Serve as a form of documentation that describes how the code is supposed to behave in various scenarios.

## Key Features

- Mocha Test Framework: Leverage Mocha's powerful and flexible testing capabilities to structure and execute tests.
- Node.js Assert Methods: Utilize built-in assertion methods from Node.js to perform various checks and validations on our code.
- Automated Testing: Enable automated execution of tests to ensure code quality consistently.
- Comprehensive Coverage: Aim for thorough test coverage across all critical components of the codebase.
- Be able to calculate the factorial of an input (only integers)

## How to Run the Tests (bash)
1. Clone the repository: <br>
  git clone https://github.com/B-Oezocak/Factorial-Feature.git <br>
  cd Rooster-Regulation
2. Install dependencies: <br>
  npm install
3. Run the tests: <br>
  npm test

## What stage of development am I in right now?

[Factorial Feature](https://github.com/B-Oezocak/Factorial-Feature) is live and should have all planned and discussed functionalities deployed.

Yes, only me again!

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on an exercise provided by CodeCademy as part of their Full-Stack Engineer career path. The structure and objectives of this project were designed by CodeCademy to help learners practice and showcase their skills in software testing and development.

## Conclusion

By completing this project, I aim to demonstrate my ability to write and organize tests, understand the importance of test coverage, and use industry-standard tools to maintain high code quality. Thank you to CodeCademy for providing this opportunity to learn and grow as a full-stack engineer.
